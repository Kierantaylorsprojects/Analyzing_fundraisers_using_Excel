# Analyzing_fundraisers_using_Excel

## Summary

For this analysis, I used many different Excel functions to clean and breakdown data oriented around fundraising campaigns.

More specifically, I used conditional formatting including VLOOKUP and COUNTIF to form new columns that categorized specific data. I then created pivot tables and produced line and bar charts to visualize our findings. 

## Findings 

1. The months of June and July may have a positive relationship to successful campaigns while the month of August seems to have more failed campaigns.
2. Out of all the sub-categories, plays seem to be the sector that utilizes the platform the most. Italy and Canada both seemed to contribute to many of the theater-based campaigns. 
3. Out of all the major parent categories, journalism is the least utilized industry for the platform. All of which are coming from the US.
